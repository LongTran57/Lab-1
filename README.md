**System-Level-Programming**

My name is Long Tran. I am a Computer Science major at Georgia State University. On my way to complete the Bachelor's Degree, CSC 3320 - System Level Programming is one of the classes I finished. This GitHub repository shows my homeworks, labs, and exams which are contents help me to achieve the goal of CSC 3320. The goal is to have experiences in using a low-level language ( C ) to interface with an operating system (UNIX) and to learn fundamental UNIX concepts, including files, processes, interprocess communication, and shells.
